This is just a really simple minor mode for Emacs that could fontify textile formatted text and provide a function to convert subset of it into plain HTML. It is based on work of Julien Barnier and his major [textile-mode](http://dev.nozav.org/textile-mode.html), in fact most of the code is from there, I just convert it to minor mode and provide an HTML converter.

I use it to blog since writing plain HTML isn't something I enjoy a lot and that is basically the main purpose of the project.

There are bugs, not all textile constructions are supported, not all of fontified make it into HTML and so on. But I do not have plans to work much on this project since what it already does is working for me just fine. If you have time and want to fix it - write me a letter, I'll make you admin here.
